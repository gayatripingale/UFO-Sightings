# UFO-Sightings
UFO Sightings using DOM and javaSript

Background:

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth. The we here at www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

The collection is too large to search through manually.having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... We only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

Let's see what we found!

Our Task:
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Create a basic HTML web page.

Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Add an input tag to your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
Level 3: Paginated Table
Complete all of Level 2 criteria.

Write code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (e.g. 50 results per page). Use Bootstrap's Pagination Components and write code to handle page changes and calculate the number of results which should appear on each page.

These changes should happen in the DOM using JavaScript, therefore the user should never be directed to another web page as they paginate through the results.
